You need to write a function in python named "add_to_database(news_list, database_url: str)"

Here "news_list" is a list of dictionaries
database_url is a "https://ep-divine-forest-a1XXXXXl.apirest.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb/rest/v1"

This url is from neon website with PostgreSQL database

Step 1: you need to drop a key from all dictionaries that is named as "body"

Step 2: Connect with the database, project name is "Next Assignment", table name is "news_db"

step 3: you need to push the values to this database.

Note: all the attribute/column values is same as key values in the dictionaries

Step 3: if the number of records in database is more than 10, then you need to do this following step
find 5 records/rows which are the oldest (you can find it from column name "timestamp") and delete them.

Step 4: done, nothing to return from the function.
